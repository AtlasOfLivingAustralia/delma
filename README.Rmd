## Overview

`delma` is a package for converting metadata statements written in markdown,
RMarkdown or Quarto markdown to Ecological Meta-language (EML). It is named for 
a genus of legless lizards that are endemic to Australia, whose name happens to
contain the letters 'e', 'm' and 'l'.

The logo depicts a striped legless lizard (_Delma impar_) in the 
style of the classic mobile game 'snake', a play on the observation that
_Delma_ are often mistaken for snakes. It was drawn by Martin Westgate.

## Installation
This package is under active development, and is not yet available on CRAN. You
can install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("AtlasOfLivingAustralia/delma")
```

Load the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(delma)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
library(dplyr)
```

## Basic usage

The primary use case for `delma` is to manipulate the format of metadata 
statements for sharing biodiversity data. The first step is to create a markdown
file, and add any headings that you like that conform to the EML standard. The 
header 'level' (i.e. number of `#`) is used to designate the degree of nesting.
If you don't want to start from scratch, you can use the example dataset 
provided:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
use_metadata()
```

It is straightforward to export this to your working directory using `write_md()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_md(metadata_example, "metadata.md")
```

Once you are done, import it to R using `read_md()`. It will be stored as a 
`tibble`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- read_md("metadata.md")
x 
```


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
system.file("extdata", 
            "README_md_example.md", 
            package = "delma") |>
  read_md()
```

You can then export it as an xml file without any intermediate steps:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_eml(x, "metadata.xml")
```

For a more detailed description of delma's capabilities and methods, see the 
'Quick start guide' vignette.
