## Overview

`paperbark` is a package for import and type conversion of metadata statements. 
Its purpose is to enable users to store metadata in markdown files, and convert
them to EML.

If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, please [contact us](mailto:support@ala.org.au).
 
## Installation
This package is under active development, and is not yet available on CRAN. You
can install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AtlasOfLivingAustralia/paperbark")
```

Load the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(paperbark)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

## Basic usage

The primary use case for `paperbark` is to import metadata into a tibble. This can
be done from a markdown file:

```{r}
x <- system.file("example_data", 
                 "README_md_example.md", 
                 package = "paperbark") |>
  read_md()

x 
```

or an xml file:

```{r}
read_eml("https://collections.ala.org.au/ws/eml/dr368")
```

Here it can be examined and modified as required, then exported to either format:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_eml(x, "metadata.xml")
write_md(x, "metadata.md")
```

For a more detailed description of paperbark's capabilities and methods, see the 
'paperbark architecture' vignette.
