## Overview

`elm` is a package for import and type conversion of metadata statements. It's
function is to enable users to store metadata in markdown files, and convert
them to EML.

If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, please [contact us](mailto:support@ala.org.au).
 
## Installation
This package is under active development, and is not yet available on CRAN. You
can install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("atlasoflivingaustralia/elm")
```

Load the package:

```{r}
library(elm)
```


## Basic usage

The basic use case for `elm` is to import markdown to a tibble:

```{r}
file <- system.file("example_data", "README_md_example.md", 
                    package = "elm")

x <- read_elm_chr(file)
x 
```

Here it can be examined and modified as required, then exported to xml:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_elm_xml(x, "metadata.xml")
```

The inverse operation - converting an `.xml` file with EML content into `.md` - 
is also possible. This can work from an xml file in your working directory, or
from a UR:

```{r}
y <- read_elm_xml("https://collections.ala.org.au/ws/eml/dr368")
y
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_elm_chr(y, "metadata.md")
```

For a more detailed description of elm's capabilities and methods, see the 
'elm architecture' vignette.

## Citing `elm`
To generate a citation for the package version you are using, you can run:

```r
citation(package = "elm")
```

The current recommended citation is:

> Westgate MJ, Balasubramaniam S & Kellie D (2024) elm: Convert markdown files
to EML. R Package version 0.1.0.
