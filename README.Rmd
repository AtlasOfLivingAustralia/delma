## Overview

`paperbark` is a package for import and type conversion of metadata statements. 
Its purpose is to enable users to store metadata in markdown files, and convert
them to EML. It is named for the peeling growth form displayed by a number of 
Australian plant species. The logo was drawn by Martin Westgate, and shows the 
flower of the swamp paperbark _Melaleuca ericifolia_.

## Installation
This package is under active development, and is not yet available on CRAN. You
can install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("AtlasOfLivingAustralia/paperbark")
```

Load the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(paperbark)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
library(dplyr)
```

## Basic usage

The primary use case for `paperbark` is to manipulate the format of metadata 
statements for sharing biodiversity data. The first step is to create a markdown
file, and add any headings that you like that conform to the EML standard. The 
header 'level' (i.e. number of `#`) is used to designate the degree of nesting.
If you don't want to start from scratch, you can use the example dataset 
`metadata_example`:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
metadata_example |>
  slice_head(n = 5)
```

It is straightforward to export this to your working directory using `write_md()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_md(metadata_example, "metadata.md")
```

Once you are done, import it to R using `read_md()`. It will be stored as a 
`tibble`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- read_md("metadata.md")
x 
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
system.file("example_data", 
                 "README_md_example.md", 
                 package = "paperbark") |>
  read_md()
```

You can then export it as an xml file without any intermediate steps:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_eml(x, "metadata.xml")
```

'Quick start guide' vignette.
