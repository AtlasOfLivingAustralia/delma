## Overview

`paperbark` is a package for import and type conversion of metadata statements. 
Its purpose is to enable users to store metadata in markdown files, and convert
them to EML. It is named for the peeling growth form displayed by a number of 
Australian plant species. The logo was drawn by Martin Westgate, and shows the 
flower of the swamp paperbark _Melaleuca ericifolia_.

## Installation
This package is under active development, and is not yet available on CRAN. You
can install the latest development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AtlasOfLivingAustralia/paperbark")
```

Load the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(paperbark)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

## Basic usage

The primary use case for `paperbark` is to create metadata statements for 
sharing biodiversity data. You can create a blank file by calling 
`use_metadata()`. When you open the resulting file, it will show a markdown file
with some pre-chosen headings, like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
as_eml_chr(metadata_example)[1:10] # a bit ugly. remove_eml_header() not working
```

You can then populate your metadata statement with whatever 
information is needed to support effective re-use. You can add further headings 
as you wish, presuming that they follow the EML standard. The header 'level' 
(i.e. number of `#`) is used to designate the degree of nesting.

Once you are done, import it to R using `read_md()`. It will be stored as a 
`tibble`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- read_md("metadata.md")
x 
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
system.file("example_data", 
                 "README_md_example.md", 
                 package = "paperbark") |>
  read_md()
```

You can then export it as an xml file without any intermediate steps:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_eml(x, "metadata.xml")
```

For a more detailed description of paperbark's capabilities and methods, see the 
'Quick start guide' vignette.
