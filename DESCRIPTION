Title: Convert Rmarkdown and Quarto documents to Ecological Metadata Language
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R:
    c(person(given = "Martin",
             family = "Westgate",
             email = "martin.westgate@csiro.au",
             role = c("aut", "cre")),
      person(given = "Shandiya",
             family = "Balasubramaniam",
             email = "shandiya.balasubramaniam@csiro.au",
             role = c("aut")),
      person(given = "Dax",
             family = "Kellie",

             role = c("aut")))
Description: Ecological Metadata Language or 'EML' is a long-established format
  for descibing ecological datasets to facilitate sharing and re-use. Because
  'EML' is effectively a modified 'xml' schema, however, it is somewhat 
  challenging to write and manipulate for non-expert users. 'delma' supports
  users to write metadata statements in 'rmarkdown' or 'Quarto' format, and
  parse them to 'EML' and (optionally) back again.
