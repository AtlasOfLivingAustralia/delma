<!--
This is a metadata template in .Rmd format, which has been formatted such that it can render either to the `output` specified in the yaml section (above) AND to Ecological Meta-language (EML) using the {paperbark} R package. Sections can be added, re-arranged or removed to suit the dataset being described. Some features to be aware of:

- Headings are converted to camelCase for use as EML tags
- Header level sets the degree of nestedness for those tags
- Code blocks whose name corresponds to a present EML tag are used to set attributes for that tag using `list()`

You can delete this section if you want. See https:://paperbark.ala.org.au for further details.

## Abstract
A brief overview of the resource. This should provide enough information to help potential users of the data to understand if it may be of interest. Example content may include what the study was designed to investigate, what taxa were observed, and over what time period.


## Methods
This section can include any methods you like, but should, at minimum, give a simple description of how the data were collected. To link to a publication with more complete information, add a level-2 heading called `Reference Publication` and add the citation to your paper.

If applicable, you can also choose to add information on data processing that are specific to this version of your dataset. This may include information on whether data on threatened species have been removed, or spatial data have been generalised (i.e. set to a lower spatial precision than the source dataset).
