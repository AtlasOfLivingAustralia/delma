Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is a "comprehensive vocabulary and a readable 
XML markup syntax for documenting research data" 
([Jones et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.5063/F11834T2)). Supplying metadata in 
this format is a requirement of several data-sharing institutions, notably 
including the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
([GBIF](https://gbif.org)) and its partner nodes. While the 
[EML package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=EML) already exists 
to support building and manipulating EML within the workspace, there is no 
comparable system for writing these documents in a more human-readable format,
such as Rmarkdown or Quarto. `delma` provides this capability.

The default method for using `delma` is to first generate a boilerplate metadata 
statement; edit it in your chosen IDE; then render it to EML:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# create a boilerplate statement
use_metadata("my_metadata_statement.Rmd")
# edit this document in IDE before calling:
render_metadata(input = "my_metadata_statement.Rmd", 
                output_file = "metadata.xml")
```

EML is quite stringent in the types of data that are allowed, as well 
as their order and placement in the hierarchy. Getting these points right can be 
challenging, and we suggest using `check_metadata()` in combination with the 
[EML schema documentation](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org) to get it right.

## Formatting your metadata statement

There are several points that are unusual about Rmarkdown documents formatted
using `delma`, which we discuss below

### Document structure

Header levels in markdown-formatted metadata statements 
determine the nested structure of the resulting xml. For example, the markdown 
file might contain this text:

```
# EML
## Dataset
### Title
My title
```

Which would parse to this in xml:
```
<EML>
  <dataset>
    <title>My title</title>
  </dataset>
<EML>
```

### Attributes

Attributes can be added to a particular EML tag by including them in a
`list` within a code block, the `label` of which is used by `delma` to link 
tags to their attributes. To add attributes to the `userId` field, for example,
you would add the following code under the `## userId` heading:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
#| label: 'userId'
#| include: false
list(directory = "https://orcid.org")
```
````

The `include: false` tag is added so that this content isn't displayed when
the document is knit.

### Setting a unique ID

Every EML document must open with the tag `eml`, and the attributes of that 
element **must** contain a unique identifier in the `packageId` field, as well 
as a link to the system within which that key is unique. A logical example might 
be a DOI:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
#| label: 'eml'
#| include: false
list(packageId = "https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.galah",
     system = "https://doi.org")
```
````

A valid alternative might be a GitHub release:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
#| label: 'eml'
#| include: false
list(packageId = "https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galah-R/releases/download/v2.1.0/galah_2.1.0.tar.gz",
     system = "https://github.com")
```
````

Note that the `eml` tag is unusual in `delma` in that it is added automatically
if not supplied. Where this occurs, all tag levels are also incremented by one 
to account for this change.


### Dynamic content

`delma` will call `rmarkdown::render()` internally whenever `read_md()`
or `render_metadata()` is used, meaning that it is possible to add dynamic 
content to your metadata statements. The boilerplate statement that ships with
delma uses this feature to automatically populate the `Title` and `Pubdate`
fields from the `YAML` section, for example:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: 'asis'
# NOTE: This is set using the yaml above; do not edit by hand
cat(rmarkdown::metadata$date)
```
````

You could also implement dynamic content using inline code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
This data contains `r readr::read_csv("my_data.csv") |> nrow()` rows.
```

## Reading, writing, and format conversion

Internally, `delma` uses the
[lightparser](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lightparser) package to convert
markdown files to `tibble`s, and the 
[xml2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xml2) package to convert `list`s to xml 
and write them to file. Between these two packages, we have written functions 
to convert between tibble and list versions of EML-formatted markdown.

Under the hood, `render_metadata()` calls `read_md()`, which does a few things:

- calls `rmarkdown::render()` on your chosen file, meaning any code blocks or
  inline code is executed properly.
- appends code blocks whose `label` matches an EML tag to the `attributes` of 
  that EML tag; this allows quite complex attribute addition without affecting 
  rendered text.
- 'cleans' the imported tibble to a small number of required columns.

This tibble is then rendered to EML using `write_eml()`. The inverse operation
is accomplished by calling `read_eml()` followed by `write_md()`.
